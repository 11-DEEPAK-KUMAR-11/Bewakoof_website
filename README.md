Our Story-
Our story starts with the name
Bewakoof.

Society perceives Bewakoof as stupid. But what does society call Bewakoof?

Often, it’s anything different or anything that’s done differently.

Often when people have done the right thing, without caring about what society thinks, they have been called Bewakoof. These are the people who have changed the world and made it a better place.

For us, Bewakoof is the spirit of looking at things differently.

Trying new things even when success is not guaranteed.

Not stepping on others to get ahead.

Thinking about the benefit of others just as you’d think about your own.

This was the spirit on which Bewakoof was founded in 2012.

With the belief that a business cannot be about financial gain alone.

It is about making a positive impact. That’s what Bewakoof is about.
